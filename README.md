# Life_cycle-Saving
Life_cycle Saving model Solver Comparison
Here I introduce Matlab and GAMS codes of a Life_cycle Saving problem for speed comparison.
The problem can be found in the pdf doc. 
The methods I use include value function iteration and convex optimization.
GAMS code is only for convex optimization method. The matlab codes are provides for both methods.
Currently, GAMS code is the fatest, CONOPT can solving a 10,000 state nodes problem within 1 min.
